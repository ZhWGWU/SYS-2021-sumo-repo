# SYS-2021-sumo-repo

This repository contains the data and code to reproduce the sumulation results in the paper entitled "Evolvability Analysis Framework: Adding Transition Path and Stakeholder Diversity to Infrastructure Investment Decisions" for publication in Systems Engineering.

To reproduce the result, install ["Simulation of Urban MObility" (SUMO)](https://sumo.dlr.de/) and run the .sumocfg file accordingly for each state. A guide to use either command-line operations or GUI operations can be found on the [tutorial page](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Tutorials/index.html). Both sumo configuration files and data were stored per state mapping the figure below (Figure 4 Case Study Operational States in the paper).
